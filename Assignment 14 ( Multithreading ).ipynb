    "# Q-1 What is multithreading in python ? Why is it used ? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans.\n",
    "# What is Multithreading in Python?\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently.\n",
    "# Each thread runs a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of the main program, allowing multiple tasks to\n",
    "# be processed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why is it Used?\n",
    "# - Concurrency: Multithreading allows Python programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently, which is useful for tasks like\n",
    "# downloading files, processing data, or running different algorithms at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - I/O-bound Tasks: Multithreading is most effective for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, web scraping, network\n",
    "# communication) where threads spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Improved Performance: While Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel execution of threads in CPU-bound \n",
    "# tasks, multithreading is still beneficial for tasks that can overlap in execution, especially when waiting for external \n",
    "# resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Module Used to Handle Threads in Python\n",
    "# The module used to handle threads in Python is the threading module. It provides a higher-level interface for managing \n",
    "# threads and is built on top of the lower-level _thread module (formerly known as thread).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here’s an example of basic multithreading using the threading module:\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def task():\n",
    "    print(\"Task started\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a time-consuming task\n",
    "    print(\"Task finished\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a thread to run the task\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=task)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for the thread to finish\n",
    "thread.join()\n",

    "# This will not execute until the thread completes\n",
